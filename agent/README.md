## üëãüèª Introducing Security Aware ChatGPT

Our fork of <a href="https://github.com/ztjhz/BetterChatGPT" target="_blank">Better ChatGPT</a> is introducing two new security-enhancing features.


# üî• Security Features
### Code Security Prefix
This feature can be enabled or disabled for each individual prompt. When enabled, it adds the a prefix the prompt:
<p align="center">
        <img src="assets/code_security_prefix.png" alt="landing" width=500 />
</p>
<span>This prefix reduced the number code vulnerabilities on average by 47% for gpt-4o-mini, and by 56% for gpt-4o (snapshot 2024-08-06) on the <a href="https://github.com/mbscit/prompt_engineering_for_secure_code_generation/prompt_benchmark/">Secure Prompt Benchmark</a>.</span>

### Code Security Agent (Experimental)
The "Code Security Agent" and can be enabled in the settings.
If enabled, markdown code-blocks in the response are intercepted.
<p align="center">
        <img src="assets/security_agent_review.png" alt="landing" width=500 />
</p>
The intercepted blocks are sent to the LLM for security-critique and improvement.  The code from the improvement response is then extracted and inserted back into the original answer.

Using the Code Security Agent with gpt-4o-2024-08-06 can reduce the number of vulnerabilities on average by 64.7\% without, and 68.7\% with the Code Security Prefix on the  <a href="https://github.com/mbscit/prompt_engineering_for_secure_code_generation/prompt_benchmark">Secure Prompt Benchmark</a>.

Since the Code Security Agent is interacting with the LLM multiple times, it can be very slow.
It can also make the code snippets overly verbose, and sometimes even break the code.
This feature is intended to gain insights into the implications of using this technique, and is therefore marked as experimental.


### Disclaimer
While these features can help reduce the number of code vulnerabilities, they are not a substitute for a security audit by a professional.  
The features are experimental and may not work as expected in all cases.

   - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (6.14.15 or above)

2. Clone this [repository](https://github.com/mbscit/prompt_engineering_for_secure_code_generation) by running `git clone https://github.com/mbscit/prompt_engineering_for_secure_code_generation.git`
3. Navigate into this directory by running `cd prompt_engineering_for_secure_code_generation/prompt_agent`
4. Run `yarn` or `npm install`, depending on whether you have yarn or npm installed.
5. Launch the app by running `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

### Running it locally using docker compose
1. Ensure that you have the following installed:
